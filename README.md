1.  Write a JAVA program to reverse the given String S. Perform the reversal
operation if and only if the string S is equivalent to S1 are equal. (Perform
case-sensitive comparison). If the strings are not equal print “Reverse Not
Supported”.
Example: String S = “Hari”, S1 = “Wipro”, output should be “Reverse Not
Supported”.

2.  Write a JAVA program to count the total upper-case and lower-case
characters of a String T. After counting, print them if and only if the count is
not equal. If the count is equal, print “Equally Distributed”.

3. Create a JAVA program to split the strings based on the white-spaces, after
the split operation, print the string with the smallest length.

4.  Create a JAVA program to split the strings based on white-spaces, after the
split operation, print all the strings in the dictionary order.

5.  Toggle the strings using JAVA. Toggling is the process of converting the
uppercase characters to lower case and vice versa.

6.  Create a JAVA program to rotate the string by clock-wise direction if the
length is even and to rotate the string to the anti-clockwise direction if the
length is odd. Perform one rotation at any case.

7.  Create a JAVA program to merge two given strings S1 and S2. Perform
merge operation by taking single character from each string.
Example: If the string S1 = “ABC”, S2= “DEF”, Output: ADBECF.

8.  Create a JAVA program to find the maximum and minimum occurred
character in a String.

9.  Create a JAVA program to sort the characters of the string S. After sorting,
extract the odd-positioned characters and store it into a string variable and
print it.

10.  Write a JAVA program to compute the string age. Age of the string can be
calculated using the formula:
Age = Length of the string S + Alphabetical index of the last-character.
Example: If the string is “ABAB”, output = (4+2) = 6.
